# Digit-Dectect
This machine Learning project aims to recognize manually written digits utilizing Python programming language. The project utilizes the prevalent MNIST dataset comprising of a huge set of 60,000 preparing pictures and 10,000 testing pictures of written by hand digits extending from 0 to 9. The project uses Convolutional Neural Systems (CNN) for picture acknowledgment and TensorFlow library for profound learning demonstrate creation. The CNN architecture is planned and prepared to distinguish the designs within the pictures, and precisely classify the digits. The extend includes pre-processing of the picture information, building the CNN show, and training the show to realize tall precision. The model's execution is assessed utilizing precision and misfortune measurements, and the project concludes with the effective classification of handwritten digits. The project's results have viable applications within the areas of character acknowledgment, picture classification, and optical character recognition (OCR).
